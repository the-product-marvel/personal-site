            <h2>The Human Behind the Product</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Maureen - a product leader who feels most at home in the messy middle,
                where clarity has to be created and decisions are rarely obvious.
                I’m energized by ambiguity, not because it’s comfortable,
                but because it’s where meaningful progress begins.

        <!-- Section: What I Care About -->
        <section>
            <h2>What I Care About</h2>
            <p>
                I care deeply about building products that feel thoughtful, humane,
                and grounded in real human needs. I’m at my best when I’m learning,
                observing, and connecting dots — between people, problems,
                and possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe good products are rarely the result of lone brilliance.
                They’re shaped through collaboration, trust, and the willingness
                to ask better questions before jumping to solutions.
            </p>

                <li>I lead with empathy and assume positive intent</li>
                <li>I forgive easily and don’t carry grudges</li>
                <li>I value clarity over cleverness</li>
                <li>I believe trust accelerates progress</li>
