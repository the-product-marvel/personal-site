            <h2>The Human Behind the Product</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Maureen - a Product Manager and Technology Leader who feels most at home in the messy middle, where
                clarity has to be created and decisions are rarely obvious. I’m energized by ambiguity, not because it’s
                comfortable, but because it’s where meaningful progress begins. I'm curious and a fast learner. You can
                teach me anything, and I’ll figure it out. I’m not afraid to ask questions, challenge
                assumptions, or admit when I don’t know something. I’m a builder at heart, and I thrive on creating
                solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives. You will never go wrong with me - I'm your best
                bet when you want someone who will show up, figure it out, and get things done.

            <h2>What I Care About</h2>
            <p>
                I care deeply about building products that feel thoughtful, humane, and grounded in real human needs.
                I’m at my best when I’m learning, observing, and connecting dots - between people, problems,
                and possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe good products are rarely the result of lone brilliance. They’re shaped through collaboration,
                trust, and the willingness to ask better questions before jumping to solutions.
