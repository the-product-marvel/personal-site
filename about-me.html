<p class="about-intro">
    I’m Maureen - a product leader who enjoys the messy middle, where clarity has to be created and decisions are rarely
    obvious.
</p>

<p class="about-body">
    I care deeply about building products that feel thoughtful, humane, and grounded in real human needs. I’m at my best
    when I’m learning, observing, and connecting dots - between people, problems, and possibilities.
